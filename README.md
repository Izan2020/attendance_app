# AttendanceApp
Creating an attendance application can be a valuable tool for schools, universities, and organizations. Recently, I had the opportunity to create an attendance application using Kotlin, with an API based on Supabase.

The application I created was designed to help instructors easily manage their classes' attendance records. It allowed them to mark students' attendance and view attendance reports quickly and easily. Additionally, the application provided a user-friendly interface that was easy to navigate.

To create the application, I used Kotlin, which is a modern programming language that is widely used for Android app development. I also utilized Supabase, which is a cloud-based API that makes it easy to build scalable and secure applications. Supabase provided a robust backend for the application, which allowed me to focus on creating a responsive front-end interface.

One of the benefits of using Supabase was the ease of integration with other third-party tools, such as Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. This allowed instructors to export attendance reports and import them into their preferred software for further analysis.

The application's UI design was clean, simple, and easy to use, making it suitable for both instructors and students. It allowed students to view their attendance records, check their class schedules, and receive notifications of upcoming classes.

In conclusion, creating an attendance application with Kotlin and Supabase was a rewarding experience that allowed me to use my skills in mobile app development and API integration. It provided a valuable tool for instructors to manage their attendance records efficiently, saving them time and effort.

### ðŸ˜Ž Application Features
âˆ™ Daily Attendance Detection <br>
âˆ™ Current Location where you've Checked-In and Checked-Out<br>
âˆ™ Send Pictures when you're Checking-In ( You can Save them Pictures or Copy the URL )

### ðŸ“¦ Database - Using the Supabase API
âˆ™ To store Attendance Pictures and Profile Pictures I use **Imgur API** <br>
âˆ™ Daily Attendance Data Detection uses the ``"date eq.now()"`` query on Params <br>
âˆ™ The database also stores where user **Checked-Out** and **Checked-In** Location by **Longtitude** and **Latitude**
